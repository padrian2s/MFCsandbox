ABOUT TROWSER
=============

Trowser is a browser for large line-oriented text files (e.g. debug traces)
implemented in Tcl/Tk.  It's meant as an alternative to "less". Compared
to less, trowser adds color highlighting, a persistent search history,
graphical bookmarking, separate search result (i.e. filter) windows and
flexible skipping of input from pipes to STDIN.  Trowser has a graphical
interface, but is designed to allow browsing via the keyboard at least
to the same extent as less. Key bindings and the cursor positioning
concept are derived from vim.

Note: in this context "line-oriented" denotes that each line of text is
considered a data unit.  Color highlighting (including search matches)
will always apply the highlight to the complete text line.

For more details and options please refer to the manual page.


INSTALL
=======

Currently trowser does not have scripts to support automatic installation.
Manual installation is very simple though: To install trowser into /usr/bin
and the manual page into /usr/share/man perform the following steps in
your shell:

$ cp trowser.tcl /usr/bin/trowser
$ cp trowser.1 /usr/share/man/man1/trowser.1

If trowser fails to start or aborts with an interpreter error, you should
check if Tcl/Tk is installed and has the required version:

$ echo 'puts $tcl_patchLevel' | tclsh
$ echo 'puts $tcl_patchLevel;exit' | wish8.4

Both commands will print the version number. The version should be 8.4.0
or later for both.  (As of writing this, trowser is tested against 8.4.14)
If you don't have "wish8.4" try just "wish". If that exists and has version
8.4.x, change the third line in trowser.tcl accordingly.
