.IX Title "TROWSER 1"
.TH TROWSER 1 "2007-10-04" "1.0" "Trace Browser"
.SH "NAME"
\&\fBtrowser\fR \- Browser for line\-oriented text files with color highlighting
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBtrowser\fR [{\-t|\-h} limit] [\-r path] {file|\-}
.PP
\&\fBtrowser\fR \-help
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBtrowser\fR is a graphical browser for large line-oriented text files
(e.g. debug trace files \- hence the name) written in Tcl/Tk.  It's meant as
an alternative to \*(L"less\*(R".  Compared to less, trowser adds color highlighting,
a persistent search history, graphical bookmarking, separate search result
(i.e. filter) windows and flexible skipping of input from pipes to \s-1STDIN\s0.
.PP
\&\fBtrowser\fR has a graphical interface, but is designed to allow browsing via
the keyboard at least to the same extent as less. Key bindings and the cursor
positioning concept are derived from vim.
.PP
Note in this context \*(L"line\-oriented\*(R" denotes that each line of text is
considered a data unit.  Color highlighting (including search matches)
will always apply the highlight to a complete line of text.
.PP
When you start trowser for the first time, you'll have to create highlight
patterns for your type of file.  To do this, first enter a search pattern
and verify that it matches the intended lines. Then open the
\&\fIEdit highlight patterns\fR dialog in the \fISearch\fR menu, press the right
mouse button to open the context menu and select \fIAdd current search\fR.
You can change the highlight color or select a different kind of mark-up
by double-clicking on the new entry in the dialog, or by selecting
\&\fIEdit markup\fR in the context menu.  To define new colors, click on
\&\fIEdit color palette\fR at the bottom of the markup editor dialog.
.PP
There are several ways to quickly navigate in the file to lines matching
search patterns: Firstly, you can search forwards or backwards to any
sub-string or pattern you enter in the \fIFind:\fR field. Secondly, you can
repeat previous searches by opening the search history dialog and
double-clicking on an entry, or by clicking \fINext\fR or \fIPrevious\fR.
Third, you can search for patterns defined in the color highlight list
by clicking on \fINext\fR or \fIPrevious\fR in the pattern list dialog.
Forth, you can open the \fISearch result list\fR (via the \fISearch\fR menu
or by clicking on \fIList all\fR in any dialog or by entering \f(CW\*(C`ALT\-a\*(C'\fR)
to display all text lines which match a set of patterns and click on an
entry in this list to jump to the respective line in the main window.
.PP
Both the bookmark and search result lists support prefixing all entries
with a \*(L"frame number\*(R". This is useful when your input file does not have
timestamp prefixes on each line. In this case trowser can search for a
preceding timestamp and automatically prefix bookmarked lines with this
number.  Additionally trowser allows to fetch a \*(L"frame number\*(R" which is
not printed in the same line as the frame interval start line. In this
case trowser searches the next frame start lines in forward and backward
direction and then inside of that range for a line containing the frame
number value.  Note for the search result list this feature is disabled
by default for performance reasons. It must be enabled in the dialog's
\&\fIOptions\fR menu.
.PP
For performance reasons most search-related commands are executed as
background processes (actually implemented as idle events in Tcl/Tk.)
For example, this applies to the initial color highlighting, global
search highlighting, incremental search while editing search patterns
and filling the search result list.  In most cases this activity is
indicated by display of a progress bar and switching the mouse cursor
to a watch or hourglass image.  You still can use trowser as usual during
this time though.  The background activity is automatically aborted or
restarted when a conflicting command is entered (e.g. when the search
pattern is modified during global search highlighting.)
.SH "KEY BINDINGS"
.IX Header "KEY BINDINGS"
Generally, keyboard focus can be moved between control elements
(e.g. buttons, checkboxes and text containers) using the \fI\s-1TAB\s0\fR or
\&\fIShift-TAB\fR.  The widget with the keyboard focus is marked by a
black border.  After start\-up, keyboard focus is in the main text
window.  Functions which are bound to mouse clicks on buttons etc.
can be activated via the keyboard using the \fISpace\fR bar. Many
functions can also be activated via shortcuts: Press the \fI\s-1ALT\s0\fR key
plus the character which is underlines in the button description
(e.g. Press \f(CW\*(C`ALT\-c\*(C'\fR to open the \fIControl\fR menu, or \f(CW\*(C`ALT\-a\*(C'\fR to
simulate a mouse-click on the \fIAll\fR button at the bottom of the
main window.)
.PP
In the following descriptions, \f(CW\*(C`^X\*(C'\fR means \fIControl-X\fR, i.e. holding the
Control key pressed while pressing the \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR key. \fI\s-1ALT\s0\fR refers to the key
to the left of the \fISpace\fR bar.  Enclosing quotes must be typed.
.Sh "Key Bindings in the Main Window"

.el .IP "\f(CW''\fR (two apostrophs)" 4
.IX Item "'' (two apostrophs)"
Moves the cursor to the position before the latest jump (same as
in vim and less)  Note any cursor movement or search operation which
may alter the cursor line position is considered a jump.
.ie n .IP """'+""\fR, \f(CW""'\-""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW'+\fR, \f(CW'\-\fR" 4
.IX Item "'+, '-"
Moves the cursor to the next or previous bookmark (not in vim)
.ie n .IP """'^""\fR, \f(CW""'$""" 4

key command or place the cursor on a given line or column (same as in vim)
For example: \f(CW\*(C`1G\*(C'\fR places the cursor in the first line of the file;
\&\f(CW\*(C`10|\*(C'\fR places the cursor in the tenth column of the current line
(line and column numbering starts at 1)
.PP
Searching and repeating:
.ie n .IP """/""\fR, \f(CW""?""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW/\fR, \f(CW?\fR" 4
.IX Item "/, ?"
Search for the following pattern (same as in vim.)
Similar to vim, the keyboard focus is moved from the main text into a
small text entry field (command line in vim) Note the previous search
pattern is always cleared when re-entering the entry field, but all
previously used patterns are still available in the history. 
.Sp
As soon as a search expression is typed into the field, an incremental
search is started and matching lines are highlighted. The cursor in
the main text isn't actually moved there until the search is completed
by pressing \f(CW\*(C`Return\*(C'\fR.  The search can be aborted by \f(CW\*(C`^C\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Escape\*(C'\fR.
For more details see \*(L"Key bindings in the search entry field\*(R".
.ie n .IP """n""\fR, \f(CW""N""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWn\fR, \f(CWN\fR" 4
.IX Item "n, N"
Repeats the previous search in forward or backwards direction
respectively (similar to vim \- however in contrary to vim \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR
always searches forward and \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR always backwards because the
standard vim behaviour of remembering and reversing the search
direction with \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR is very confusing.)
.ie n .IP "\ ""*""\fR, \f(CW""#""" 4
.el .IP "\ \f(CW*\fR, \f(CW#\fR" 4
.IX Item "*, #"
Searches for the word under the cursor in forward or backwards direction
respectively (same as in vim)
.ie n .IP """&""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW&\fR" 4
.IX Item "&"
Remove the highlighting of previous search matches (same as :nohlsearch
in vim)  Note this does not disable highlighting in subsequent searches.
.ie n .IP "\fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR""f""" 4
.el .IP "\fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR\f(CWf\fR" 4
.IX Item "ALT-f"
Moves the focus in the search search entry field.  This is equivalent to
\&\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR but without changing the search direction (not in vim)
This is equivalent to clicking into the \*(L"Find:\*(R" entry field with the
mouse button.
.ie n .IP "\fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR""n""\fR, \fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR\f(CW""p""" 4

Repeat a previous search, equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR (not in vim)
.ie n .IP "\fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR""h""" 4
.el .IP "\fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR\f(CWh\fR" 4

Enable the \*(L"Highlight all\*(R" option, i.e. highlight all lines in the text
where the current search pattern matches (not in vim)
.ie n .IP "\fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR""a""" 4
.el .IP "\fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR\f(CWa\fR" 4
.IX Item "ALT-a"
Open the search result window and fill it with all text lines which match
the current search pattern (not in vim)
.PP
The following commands can be used to change the selection.
.PP
Note that selected text is automatically exported and can be pasted
into other applications.
.IP "\fIShift-Left\fR, \fIShift-Right\fR, \fIShift-Up\fR, \fIShift-Down\fR" 4
.IX Item "Shift-Left, Shift-Right, Shift-Up, Shift-Down"
Starts or extends the selection in the respective direction (not in vim)
Note that trowser only supports the character-wise selection mode (like
\&\f(CW\*(C`v\*(C'\fR in vim)
.IP "\fIShift-Home\fR, \fIShift-End\fR" 4
.IX Item "Shift-Home, Shift-End"
Starts or extends the selection from the current cursor position to the
start or end of the current line (not in vim)
.IP "\fIControl-Shift-Home\fR, \fIControl-Shift-End\fR" 4
.IX Item "Control-Shift-Home, Control-Shift-End"
Starts or extends the selection from the current cursor position to the
start or end of the file (not in vim)
.IP "^c" 4
.IX Item "^c"
Copies the currently selected text to the clipboard.  (Note that this
command is actually superfluous as the text is copied as soon as some
text is selected.)
.PP
Misc. commands:
.ie n .IP """m""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWm\fR" 4
.IX Item "m"
This key, or double-clicking into a text line, toggles a bookmark in the
respective line (different from vim; note setting named bookmarks is not
supported)
.IP "\fIi\fR" 4
.IX Item "i"
Insert the current text line (or selection, if one currently exists) into
the search result window (different from vim)
.ie n .IP "\fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR""+""\fR, \fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR\f(CW""\-""" 4
.el .IP "\fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR\f(CW+\fR, \fI\s-1ALT\-\s0\fR\f(CW\-\fR" 4
.IX Item "ALT-+, ALT--"
Increases or decreases the font size for the text content. Note the behaviour
when reaching the maximum or minimum font size is not defined.
.Sh "Key Bindings in the Search Entry Field"
.IX Subsection "Key Bindings in the Search Entry Field"
The following commands can be used when the keyboard focus is in the
\&\fBsearch entry field\fR at the bottom of the main window:
.IP "\fIReturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "Return"
Store the current pattern in the search history and return focus to the main
window with the cursor on the next match (same as vim)   Note the cursor is
already moved when entering the text, including highlighting of adjacent
matches.  Note this command is equivalent to leaving the search field by
clicking with the mouse outside or switching keyboard focus via \fI\s-1TAB\s0\fR or
\&\fIShift-TAB\fR.
.ie n .IP "\fIEscape\fR, ""^c""" 4
.el .IP "\fIEscape\fR, \f(CW^c\fR" 4
.IX Item "Escape, ^c"

cursor on the previous position (same as in vim)
.ie n .IP """^a""\fR, \f(CW""^e""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW^a\fR, \f(CW^e\fR" 4
.IX Item "^a, ^e"
Move the insertion cursor to the start or end of the search text entry field
(not in vim.)  Note: movement and selection via cursor keys works in the same
way as described for the main text.
.ie n .IP """^n""\fR, \f(CW""^N""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW^n\fR, \f(CW^N\fR" 4
.IX Item "^n, ^N"
Jump to the next match on the current pattern. Note this does not affect the
fall-back cursor position, i.e. when the search is aborted or the pattern is
changed, the cursor returns to the original start position (not in vim)
.IP "\fIUp\fR, \fIDown\fR" 4
.IX Item "Up, Down"
Copies the previous or next pattern in the search history into the entry
field. If the entry field already contains some text, the search is
restoricted to patterns with the same prefix.
.ie n .IP """^d""\fR, \f(CW""^D""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW^d\fR, \f(CW^D\fR" 4
.IX Item "^d, ^D"
Complete the search text with the text to the right or left of the current
match in the main text (i.e. right or left of the text marked with green
background color.)
.ie n .IP """^x""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW^x\fR" 4
.IX Item "^x"
Remove the currently used pattern in the search history, if the current
pattern was copied by use of \fIUp\fR or \fIDown\fR
.ie n .IP """^h""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW^h\fR" 4
.IX Item "^h"
Add the current search pattern as new color highlight pattern.
.ie n .IP """^H""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW^H\fR" 4
.IX Item "^H"
Opens the search history dialog.
.ie n .IP "\fIAlt\-\fR""n""\fR, \fIAlt\-\fR\f(CW""p""" 4
.el .IP "\fIAlt\-\fR\f(CWn\fR, \fIAlt\-\fR\f(CWp\fR" 4
.IX Item "Alt-n, Alt-p"
Same as pressing the \fINext\fR or \fIPrevious\fR buttons respectively, i.e. search
for the current pattern in forward or backwards direction and add the pattern
to the search history. Keyboard focus remains in the search entry field.
.ie n .IP "\fIAlt\-\fR""a""" 4
.el .IP "\fIAlt\-\fR\f(CWa\fR" 4
.IX Item "Alt-a"
Open the search result window and fill it with all text lines which match
the current search pattern (not in vim)
.ie n .IP "\fIAlt\-\fR""c""" 4
.el .IP "\fIAlt\-\fR\f(CWc\fR" 4
.IX Item "Alt-c"
Toggle the \*(L"match case\*(R" option, i.e. equivalent to clicking on \fIMatch case\fR
(not in vim)
.ie n .IP "\fIAlt\-\fR""e""" 4
.el .IP "\fIAlt\-\fR\f(CWe\fR" 4
.IX Item "Alt-e"
Toggle the \*(L"Reg.Exp.\*(R" option, i.e. equivalent to clicking on \fIMatch case\fR
(not in vim)  When this option is enabled, special characters are parsed
according to \fIre_syntax\fR manual page; the syntax is almost identical to Perl
with the exception of a few special characters (notably \f(CW\*(C`\em\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eM\*(C'\fR to
match beginning and end of words)  When the option is not enabled, no
characters have a special meaning (i.e. even \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR) and a simple sub-string
search is started.
.Sp
Note: for performance reasons it's recommended to use case-sensitive
sub-string searches for color highlighting, especially if you have many
patterns. This is usually faster than combining multiple patterns
with \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR in a regular expression.
.Sh "Key Bindings in Dialogs"
.IX Subsection "Key Bindings in Dialogs"
The following commands can be used to manipulate the selection cursor
in all dialogs which display lists (i.e. search result list,
search history, bookmarks, highlight pattern editor)  Note there's
no distinction between selection and cursor in these dialogs. This
means you cannot move the selection cursor from line A to D using
the keyboard without temporarily selectiing lines B and C in\-between.
.PP
Of course you can also manipulate the selection via the mouse in the
usual ways, i.e. clicking on single entries, or dragging the mouse
to select multiple elements, or pressing the mouse while holding
Control or Shift keys pressed to add or remove single elements or
extend the selection respectively.
.IP "\fIUp\fR, \fIDown\fR" 4
.IX Item "Up, Down"
Move the selection cursor one line up or down respectively, scrolling
the view if necessary.  If no line is selected yet, the cursor is
placed on the first or last line; if the previously selected line is
still in the visible area, the cursor is placed there instead.
.IP "\fIHome\fR, \fIEnd\fR" 4
.IX Item "Home, End"
Move the selection cursor on the first or last item in the list.
.IP "\fIShift-Up\fR, \fIShift-Down\fR, \fIShift-Home\fR, \fIShift-End\fR" 4
.IX Item "Shift-Up, Shift-Down, Shift-Home, Shift-End"
Extend or reduce the selection in the given direction, or to the
start or end of the list.
.IP "\fIPage-Up\fR, \fIPage-Down\fR" 4
.IX Item "Page-Up, Page-Down"
Scroll the view up or down by a page. These commands remove the
selection cursor.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The following command line options are available:
.IP "\fB\-h\fR \fIlimit\fR, \fB\-\-head=limit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h limit, --head=limit"
This option specifies the maximum number of bytes read from the start
of the input file or stream, i.e. any following text is silently
ignored.
.Sp
The limit value is remembered in the configuration file and used in
the next invocation unless overridden.  When neither \fB\-h\fR or \fB\-t\fR are
specified and data is loaded from a stream via \s-1STDIN\s0, a small dialog
window pops up when the buffer limit is exceeded. This allows the user
to select between head and tail modes manually.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR \fIlimit\fR, \fB\-\-tail=limit\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t limit, --tail=limit"
This option specifies the maximum number of bytes to be read into the
display buffer.  If the input is a file which is larger then the given
buffer limit, text at the beginning of the file is skipped. If the
input is a stream, all data is read into a temporary queue until
the end-of-stream is reached; then the last \fIlimit\fR number of bytes
which were read from the stream are loaded into the display buffer.
.Sp
The limit value is remembered in the configuration file and used in
the next invocation unless overridden.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR \fIpath\fR, \fB\-\-rcfile=path\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r path, --rcfile=path"
This option can be used to specify an alternate configuration file.
When this option is not present, the configuration file is stored in
the home directory, see \s-1FILES\s0.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
\&\fBtrowser\fR only evaluates the standard variables \fB\s-1DISPLAY\s0\fR (X11 display
address) and \fB\s-1HOME\s0\fR (home directory, for storing the configuration file.)
.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"
.IP "\fB$HOME/.trowserc\fR" 4
.IX Item "$HOME/.trowserc"
Configuration file where all personal settings are stored. Per default
this is created in your home directory, but a different path and file
name can be specified with the \fB\-\-rcfile\fR option (see \*(L"\s-1OPTIONS\s0\*(R").
.SH "CEVEATS"
.IX Header "CEVEATS"
Currently only one pattern list for color highlighting is supported.
Hence different highlighting for different file types can only be done
by chosing different configuration files when starting trowser
(see the \fI\-\-rcfile\fR option.)
.Sp
Not all vim navigation commands are implemented yet; Command repetition
is supported only for a small sub-set of commands; Some commands behave
slightly differently from vim (most notably the bookmark related commands.)
vim's range and selection commands are not supported at all.
.Sp
Search repetition by pressing \*(L"Next\*(R" or \*(L"Previous\*(R" or the search history
dialog is currently not interruptable and may take quite a while if the
next match is several \s-1MB\s0 away. (This can be avoided by repeating the
search via the entry field's internal search history, i.e. \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR and \fIUp\fR)
.Sp
File store and load dialogs do not maintain a history of previously
used files or directories. (This is so because it's expected that these
features will not be used very often.)
.Sp
The pipe load and search result list dialogs are not designed very
well yet (i.e. even more so than the other dialogs). Suggestions for
improvements are welcome.
.Sp
Some configuration options cannot be modified via the \s-1GUI\s0 and require
to manually edit the configuration file.
