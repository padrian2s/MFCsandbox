    This file contains Version 1.88 of RLTools, 32-bit Edition.

    This edition runs only on a Windows NT system but will handle any Win32
    executable-format (.EXE, .DLL, etc.) or resource (.RES) source file.

    The localizable resources are extracted directly from the source file
    and presented to the user for translation.  There is a command-line
    tool called RLMan, a one-pass tool called RLQuiked, and a long-term
    project set of tools - RLAdmin and RLEdit.  Also included is the
    complete on-line Help, tool documentation and a tutorial document.

    RLTools is not supported but improvements are made frquently and made
    available upon request. Send the request to the person from whom you
    received this version of RLTools.

    To install RLTools, copy RLTools.zip to the directory in which you wish
    the tool set to be installed, un-zip the file, and remove the RLTools.ZIP
    file. Make sure this directory is added to your system's PATH because
    when the tool dlgedit.exe is called by the other tools, they assume it
    is in a directory in your PATH.
